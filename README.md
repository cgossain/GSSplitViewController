Notes
-------------------------------

- This project was developed and tested on iOS 7. Lower OS versions may or may not work.

GSSplitViewController Interface
-----------------------------

The GSSplitViewController interface mimics the UISplitViewController interface with the addition of the 'masterPaneWidth' property. This property allows you to change the width of the master pane.

GSSplitViewController Delegate
------------------------------

The GSSplitViewController delegate for the most part mimics the UISplitViewController's delegate. Just note that no popover controller is returned and there are a fewer methods.
