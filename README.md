Notes
-------------------------------

- This project was developed and tested on iOS 7. Lower OS versions may or may not work.

GSSplitViewController Interface
-----------------------------

The GSSplitViewController interface mimics the UISplitViewController interface, and adds the ability to adjust the width of the master pane via the 'masterPaneWidth' property. It also adds a few other convenient properties and methods to help create a more custom user interface.

GSSplitViewController Delegate
------------------------------

The GSSplitViewController delegate for the most part mimics the UISplitViewController's delegate. Just note that no popover controller is returned and there are a fewer methods.
